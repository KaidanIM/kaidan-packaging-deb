Description: Simple, user-friendly Jabber/XMPP client for every device
 It's providing a modern user-interface using Kirigami and QtQuick. The
 back-end of Kaidan is completely written in C++ using the gloox XMPP Library
 and Qt 5. As gloox, Kaidan is released
 under the GPL (Version 3 or later).
 .
 Kaidan is not finished: Don't expect it to work as well as a finished
 messenger will.
